### TDNN Approximation for Backbone Torsion Angles.ipynb

As the name suggests, this is my attempt at creating a TDNN that attempts to predict backbone torsion angles from the CDR-H3 residues.

## Supporting functions

The **common** directory contains some supporting Python for the grabbing and wrangling of the data for our neural network. For most users, it's enough to know it spits out numpy arrays for our train, test and validate sets.
